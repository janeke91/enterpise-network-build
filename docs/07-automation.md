# 07. Automation (Ansible)

## Design

- **Control node:** `ansible` (10.10.10.20), a small Debian VM in MGMT (VLAN 10). It holds the SSH key that opens every managed host, so it is treated like the hypervisor: it lives only in the management zone.
- **Firewall:** MGMT rules 4 and 5 use the alias `ADMIN_HOSTS` (admin laptop and `ansible`) as source. Everything else stays unchanged: Ansible reaches the VMs only on TCP/22, like an administrator.
- **Authentication:** SSH key (ed25519) protected by a passphrase, loaded into `ssh-agent` per session. Privilege escalation through `sudo` with the password entered at run time (`--ask-become-pass`). No passwords or keys are stored in this repository.
- **Inventory:** `ansible/inventory.ini`. Groups are named `*_hosts` to avoid clashing with host names.

## Playbooks

| Playbook | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ansible/update.yml` | Refreshes the apt cache, upgrades packages one host at a time (`serial: 1`), compares the running kernel with the newest installed kernel, and prints a one-line report per host (packages upgraded, reboot required or not). Hosts that fail or are unreachable show up as `NO DATA` in the report. |

| `ansible/audit.yml` | Read-only security audit per host: effective sshd settings (root login, password authentication), listening ports compared with a per-host baseline (unexpected and missing ports), pending security updates. Prints `PASS` or `FAIL` with reasons. |
| `ansible/node_exporter.yml` | Installs and starts `prometheus-node-exporter` on the monitoring VM (idempotent). |

Run:

```bash
cd ansible
eval $(ssh-agent) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/ansible_ed25519
ansible all -m ping
ansible-playbook update.yml --check --ask-become-pass   # dry run
ansible-playbook update.yml --ask-become-pass
```

## Design decisions

- **No automatic reboots.** A reboot of the Proxmox host stops every VM, so playbooks only report that a reboot is needed.
- **One host at a time** (`serial: 1`): a failed upgrade affects a single host.
- **Dry run first** (`--check`).
- **Not managed yet:** pfSense (not Debian), the Proxmox host and the Windows domain controller (needs WinRM and its own firewall rules).

## Audit findings and what was done

| Finding | Hosts | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| `PasswordAuthentication yes` | all | Open. To be disabled during hardening, only after key login is verified from every admin machine |
| UDP 68 and 546 listening | all | DHCP client sockets, accepted in the baseline (documented in the playbook) |
| Port 9100 missing | monitoring | Real gap: the monitoring server was not monitored. Fixed with `node_exporter.yml` and a new Prometheus target |
| A random high port seen once | monitoring | Transient socket, gone on re-check |

An audit baseline is a statement of what is expected. Fixing the baseline is only valid when the reason is written down.

## Planned

- Hardening playbook (SSH key-only login) with before/after audit, and a Lynis score
- Backup playbook: run `vzdump`, verify the result, copy to a separate disk (pending hardware)
- Run on a schedule after boot, once a restricted `sudo` policy is defined for unattended use
